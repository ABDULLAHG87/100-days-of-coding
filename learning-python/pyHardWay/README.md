## TITLE: Practicing Learning Python the hardway

## DESCRIPTION:
In my quest to learning python the hardway with 21 days, one of the beginner materials is Python3 the Hardway.
This project involves replicating all exercises within the materials to understand reading, writting, analyzing code and spotting the difference as illustrated by the author of the book

| EXCERCISES | LESSONS |
|------------|----------|
|ex1.py|Exploration of Python print command and string literals|

## EXPLANATION OF EXERCISE SOURCE CODE

### ex1.py
The source code explores various ways of using the print command to sent output to the console.
It also explains strings literals which can be enclosed in single quote or double quotes

**TAKEAWAY**: if one of the enclosing quotes ' or " is missing it flags the Syntaxs Error: EOL while scanning the string literal
